# CroquemADAme - YouNiverse : guiding manual to become famous
***
## Abstract
Becoming famous on the youtube platform is the dream of many small youtubers, but the youtube rules may be difficult to follow. We would want to create a guideline for every starting youtuber. What is the perfect length of the video, how long does it take to have a buzz video, what tags to use, what are the best contents/categories, what is the best period to post etc.
